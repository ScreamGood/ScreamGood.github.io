<p> <p class="answer">Here are some common-sense rules that'll help you steer clear of trouble. Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart. Don't try to look for loopholes or try to lawyer your way around the guidelinesâ€”just understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created.</p>

<h2>We review your reports carefully</h2>
<p>

You might not like everything you see on Svizzr. Some of the content might offend you. If you think it's inappropriate, locate the reporting feature on the picture and submit it for review by our Svizzr staff.

Our staff reviews flagged videos 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to determine whether they violate our Community Guidelines. When they do, we remove them. Sometimes a picture doesn't violate our guidelines, but might not be appropriate for everyone. These videos may get age-restricted. Accounts are penalized for Community Guidelines violations, and serious or repeated violations can lead to account termination. If an account is terminated, that person won't be allowed to create any new accounts.</p>
